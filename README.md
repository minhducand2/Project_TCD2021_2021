"# Project_TCD0201_2021" 

This is my company's project, and I'm a major part of it. Also, the issues related to the API or something else are not mine, especially the API it is the company's, and the servers belong to the company. Besides, this is a .Net core commercial sales website, and its full name is "Commercial sales website .Net core" because the customer chose this name. Not only that, this project is completely owned by me and the client specified it. Moreover, this website links and shares to Facebook, Instagram, etc. Another surprise, pay for the product is PayPal and which will have 2 languages: English and Vietnamese.

_The project will be designed according to the Microservice model.




_Language for Front End will incorporate Angular 11 Framework.




_Language for Back End (Restful API) will use .NET Core.




_Database using SQL server.




_All projects will be saved on a cloud computing platform with docker.
